Difference Between HTTP\1.1 and HTTP\2.0

1)HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1.
2)HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it. 
 HTTP/2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.(Multiplexing)
3)HTTP/2 uses a more advanced compression method called HPACK that eliminates redundant information in HTTP header packets. 
 This eliminates a few bytes from every HTTP packet.(Header Compression)
4)HTTP/2 servers push likely-to-be-used resources into a browser’s cache, even before they’re requested. 
  This allows browsers to display content without additional request cycles.(Server Push)
5)Web browsers only support HTTP/2 via encrypted connections, increasing user and application security.(Increased Security)
