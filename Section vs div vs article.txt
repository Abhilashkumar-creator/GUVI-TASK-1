1)<section>

The <section> element represents a generic section of a document or application.

-->A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content.
-->  A Web site’s home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.
-->The section element is not a generic container element. The section element is appropriate only if the contents would be listed explicitly in the document’s outline.
-->A section typically with a heading.

2)<div>

The <div> element has no special meaning at all.

-->It can be used with the class, lang, and title attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements.
-->When no other element is suitable, the div element is used as an element of last resort. Otherwise, it leads to poor accessibility for reader.

3)<article>

The <article> element represents a independent item section of content. It must have a <h1> tag for title.
-->In principle, content in the article element should be independently distributable or reusable.
